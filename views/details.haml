    %h1{:class => 'cursive text-center'}What You Need To Know
    %h2 If you have any questions, you know you can ask us!
    %p What's this thing anyway?
    %p We know we eloped (sorry we're not sorry). But we have all these wonderful friends and family members that missed out on sipping champagne and dancing with us. We throwing this celebration and ceremony to share the joy of our marriage with you.
    
    %p This is a community wedding.
    %p Sounds like you are turning into hippies (kind-of, we do live in LA now...) Really though, we can't stress enough how we want everyone to be around us and having a great time. We're asking that you BYOB if you're joining us Friday, bring something for a potluck Lunch Saturday (see your invite), and help out whenever you can around the house. We scrapped the wedding planner to buy you more booze. You're welcome.
    
    %p What's the dress code?
    %p We're glad you asked! For the majority of the weekend the dress code is fun in the sun. Shorts, skirts, bathing suits, etc. However, for just a little bit of time (precisely Saturday from 6-12pm) please wear all white. Yep, all white. Guys, those super super super light khakis are OK.

    %p What's this house like?
    %p This house is awesome. We're going to have tons of lawn games, a fire pit, kayaks, swimming, lounge chairs and pretty cool people all for you to enjoy. Spend as much time there as you can, we want to see you! A few house rules:
    %p 1. No smoking on the premises
    %p 2. Do not feed the ducks
    %p 3. Pets are not welcome (this is such a bummer but trust us, it's better)
    %p 4. No parking in the driveway (there is an entire street that is all yours!)
